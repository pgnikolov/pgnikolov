### Hello, my name is Plamen Nikolov and I am a Python developer who enjoys the development of useful solutions and optimization of existing processes.


### ❓ **Who Am I**: 

At the moment, I am a student at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/curriculum), where I continue my education in Python and other related technologies. 
In addition to my studies, I work as a Process Operator at Martens Kunststoffen B.V., which helps me apply my technical skills in real-world situations.
I am very interested and eager to learn new tools and techniques. My goal is to write clean, efficient code. I love solving problems, streamlining processes, and developing integrated solutions.

### 🤝 **Let’s Work Together**:

Anyone who wants to discuss issues around Python, software development, or any partnership possibilities can contact me through [![Gmail](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gmail-D14836?logo=gmail&logoColor=white)](mailto:pgnikolov@gmail.com) or [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linkedin-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgnikolov/).

### 🏖️ **When I Am Not Coding**:

In my spare time, when I’m not immersed in Python code, I enjoy traveling the world 🌍, or more commonly, taking my dog 🐕 on a hike. 
I am always eager to try new activities and I like to switch my focus from technology to nature.
Photography 📸 is also a big passion of mine—it’s a hobby that allows me to capture the beauty of the world around me, combining creativity and technical skill.
